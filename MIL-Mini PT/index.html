            <br><br>
            <p>Minors can be groomed both online and offline, either by someone they know or a stranger. This may include family members, friends, or individuals in positions of authority such as teachers, religious leaders, or coaches.</p>
  
            <br>
  
            <p>In online grooming situations, perpetrators may conceal their identity by sending images or videos of someone else, often of a younger age to establish trust with the victim. They may contact multiple children at once and wait for responses, or they may specifically target one child.</p>

            <br>
            <p>
              Grooming can result in both immediate and long-lasting consequences, regardless of whether it occurred in person or online. The repercussions of grooming may persist for the rest of an individual's life. It could lead to sleep disturbances, anxiety, and difficulty in concentrating or managing academic responsibilities for children or adolescents. Additionally, they may display withdrawn behavior, reluctance to communicate, and experience emotional turmoil like anger or sadness.

            <h1>PROTECTION THROUGH PREVENTION</h1>

            <br><br><br>

            <p>As social media platforms, online games, and instant messaging apps continue to expand, children now have the ability to communicate with people from all over the world, including strangers, in just a matter of minutes. While this can help children feel less isolated, it can also expose them to potential grooming, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation.</p>

            <br>

            <p>According to InternetMatters.org, a important factor to consider in minimising the risks of exposure to online grooming of young adolescence is by giving the right advice regarding how to navigate digital space.</p>
            
            <br>

            <p>The most effective approach in combating grooming is prevention, which involves ensuring that children are well educated in navigating and manipulating online and digital space safely.</p>
